# Protector
Course project for Internet Computing

This is a simple 2-player game which has 2 modes: PVP and COOP.

## PVP mode: 
You need to control your knight to protect your dearest princess, while your opponent is doing the same thing!

**Princess Dodge! Knight, kill opponent's princess! Only if so will opponent's knight be upset and loses!**

## COOP mode:
You need to cooperate with another player, each controlling either knight or princess. 

**Your goal is to stay alive, and kill as many bad guys as possible!**

Sounds simple, but not so simple when you play it ;)
